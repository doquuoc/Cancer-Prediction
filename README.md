# Cancer-Prediction

The provided dataset is a synthetically generated collection of information aimed at simulating a cancer prediction scenario for research purposes. It comprises 10,000 pseudo-patients, each characterized by five distinct parameters, namely: Gender, Age, Smoking, Fatigue, and Allergy, along with a binary indicator denoting the presence or absence of cancer. This synthetic dataset serves as a tool for researchers to explore and experiment with predictive models for cancer detection.
